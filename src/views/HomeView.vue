      <p class="p-4 pt-0">I’m a multimedia designer at EASV, who likes to create, design, and code. During my time
        there and
        in my spare
        time, I’ve done a buncha projects, ranging from websites to videos and everything in between. I’m always looking
        for new ways to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what I can create. <br>

        In my spare time I create my own music, study Japanese for fun, and rot in my bed.</p>
